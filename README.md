# Information Theory and Data Compression Portfolio

This portfolio contains several compression algorithms implementations required to pass the exam of the Master's course in Information Theory and Data Compression.
Implementing such algorithms was useful to improve my Python skills and to have a better understanding about how the compression alggorithm works.
